# Precompute the vignette and the website articles.
#
# Several articles run tens of thousands of bootstrap replications, and some
# show Stata output. They are therefore not rendered from scratch when the
# package or the site is built. Each `*.Rmd.orig` source under vignettes/ is
# knitted once, here, into a plain `*.Rmd` that already contains the code, its
# output and its figures; R CMD build and pkgdown then only format that file.
#
# Usage, from the package root:
#
#     Rscript precompute/precompile.R              # every *.Rmd.orig
#     Rscript precompute/precompile.R ceo-pay      # one or more, by name
#
# What it needs is listed in precompute/README.md.
